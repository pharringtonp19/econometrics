Applied econometrics is fundamentally about **interpretation** -- how to interpret the result of a statistical procedure in a given context. Often, there isn't often a "valid" or "correct" interpretation. Much like a work of art, there are multiple interpretions available. In this course, we'll introduce you to a broad set of statitical tools and real life examples so that you can further develop your own **judgement**.

Learning from data is a highly personalized process. The general setup of the process is reflected visually below. We have beliefs about the world; we have beliefs about how a statical procedure behaves under certain conditions; the statistical procedure is applied to a data set returning numerical "results" which ultimately shape our new beliefs about the world.

<!-- #### Models 

We will never assume that the relationship is linear and moreover, we're not going to be centrally focused on fitting linear models

  Under selection on observables, linear regression can perform poorly: Reproduced <a href="https://github.com/pharringtonp19/econometrics/blob/main/notebooks/approximation/Linear_Issues.ipynb">Here</a>

We'll work from a more general setup 

$$Y_i(D) = f(X_i, D) + \varepsilon_i(D)$$
