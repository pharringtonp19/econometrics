Applied econometrics is fundamentally about **interpretation** -- how to interpret the result of a statistical procedure in a given context. Generally, though, there isn't a "valid" or correct interpretation. This type of work is actually quite similair to a litterature or art-history class[^1], where the aim is to develop/enhance your ability to interpret different works/results. 

The general setup is as follows: we have beliefs about the world; we have beliefs about how a statical procedure behaves under certain conditions' the statistical procedure is applied to a data set providing use with numerical "results" which ultimately lead to new beliefs about the world.

This is a highly personal process because your new beliefs depend on both your original beliefs about the world and your beliefs about the statistical procedure. **Elaborate Here**
