<p style="text-align: center;">Applied Econometrics is a highly personalized endevour </p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;color:#404065;font-weight:bold;">Summary</h2>

Applied econometrics is fundamentally about **interpretation** -- how to interpret the result of a statistical procedure in a given context. Generally, though, there isn't a "valid" or correct interpretation. Applied econometrics is not a math class! Rather, it's much more similair to a literature or art-history class[^1]. 

The general setup is as follows: we have beliefs about the world; we have beliefs about how a statical procedure behaves under certain conditions' the statistical procedure is applied to a data set providing use with numerical "results" which ultimately lead to new beliefs about the world. 

This is a highly personal process because your new beliefs depend on both your original beliefs about the world and your beliefs about the statistical procedure. **Elaborate Here**
