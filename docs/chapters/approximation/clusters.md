### **Convex Representation** 

The Caratheodori Theorem tells us that any point $x \in \textrm{Con}(T)$, where $T \subset \mathcal{R}^n$, can be represented as a convex combination of at most $n+1$ points.[^1]

So for example let's say that our features $x \in \mathcal{R}^n$. Then for any point in the convex hull of the training set can be represented as the convex combination of at most ten points

$$x = \sum _{i=1}^{11} x_i^*(x), \quad x \in \mathcal{R}^{10}$$
