### **Propensity Score**

The propensity score is observable: 

$$\pi(X_i) = \mathbb{P}(D_i = 1 \mid X_i)$$

That is, given access to the following probability space, we can compute the probability measure. 

$$\big( \mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{D} \times \mathcal{Y}, \mathcal{F}, \mathcal{P} \big)$$
