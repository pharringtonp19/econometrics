### **Introduction**

Integration can be thought of as a function that takes a probability measure, a set, and a random variable 

$$\begin{align*}
&\mathcal{I} :: \mathcal{M} \to \mathcal{F} \to \{\Omega \to \mathcal{R} \} \to \mathcal{R} \cup \{	\pm \infty\}\\ 
&\mathcal{I} \ \mathbb{P} \ A \ X = \int _A X d\mathbb{P}
\end{align*}$$

#### **Lebesgue Integral**

The lebesgue intergral is simply the following where $\lambda$ denotes the lebesgue measure

$$\mathcal{I} \ \lambda$$


#### **Linearity**

You have probably heard in various classes that integration is a linear function. What people mean by this is that the following higher-order function is linear 

$$\mathcal{I} \ \mathcal{P} \ A $$



### **Working Across Probability Spaces**


$$\int _A fd\mathbb{P} = \int_{f(A)} x d\mathbb{P}_f$$

??? warning "To Do"

    is $f(A)$ a measurable set??
