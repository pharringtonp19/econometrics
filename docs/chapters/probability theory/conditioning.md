## **Conditioning**

Given a measurable space

$$\big(\Omega, \mathcal{F}\big)$$

??? inline end note "Different Signature"

    If we had "rearranged" the signature of $C$ as follows: 

    $$C :: \mathcal{F}_+ \to \mathcal{M} \to \mathcal{M} $$

    Then $C \  \Omega$ would be the identity function

Let $\mathcal{M}$ be the set of probability measures defined on this space. Then conditioning can be defined as follows:

$$\begin{align*}
&C :: \mathcal{M} \to \mathcal{F}_+ \to \mathcal{M} \\
& C \ \mathbb{P} \ A  \ B = \frac{\mathbb{P}(A \cap B)}{\mathbb{P}(A)} \end{align*}$$
