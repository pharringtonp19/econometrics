### $\sigma$-algebra of a Random Variable

Information. What information about the sample space, $\Omega$, does a random variable, $X$, convey. 

For any element of the Borel $\sigma$-algebra we can tell whether that element occured. 

$$X(\omega) \in B, \quad \textrm{or} \quad  X(\omega) \notin B$$ 

Therefore, we know 

$$ \omega \in X^{-1}(B), \quad \textrm{or} \quad  \omega \notin X^{-1}(B)$$ 

We refer to this set of events as the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $X$. Importantly, it is the set of events that we can tell whether or not they occured if we have $X$.
