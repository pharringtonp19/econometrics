### $\sigma$-algebra of a Random Variable

The motivating question is where some event, $A \in \Omega$ occured? That is, we're thinking that $omega$ is realized, and we want to know whether $\omega \in A$. The underlying assumption in this context is that we don't observe $\omega$ directly (if we did, it wouldn't be much of a question). If we saw that we got a two when we rolled a die, we know that the event of an even number occured. 

So we don't observe $\omega$, but whether $B \in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{R})$ occured. For any element of the Borel $\sigma$-algebra we can tell whether that element occured. What is again lurking in the details here is that there is a random variable that maps from $\Omega$ to $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{R})$ (how else, you are thinking did the Borel $\sigma$-algebra come into play?). 

With these two pieces of information, we therefore know whether $X^{-1}(B)$ occured. We refer this this set of events as the $\sigma$-algebra generated by the random variable $X$. Again, it is the set of events in the orginal event space whose occurance is determined by the realization of $X$.
