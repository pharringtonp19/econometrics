### **$\sigma$-algebra of a Random Variable**

Information. What information about the sample space, $\Omega$, does a random variable, $X$, convey. 

For any element of the Borel $\sigma$-algebra we can tell whether that element occured. 

$$X(\omega) \in B, \quad \textrm{or} \quad  X(\omega) \notin B$$ 

Therefore, we know 

$$ \omega \in X^{-1}(B), \quad \textrm{or} \quad  \omega \notin X^{-1}(B)$$ 

We refer to this set of events as the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $X$. Importantly, it is the set of events that we can tell whether or not they occured if we have $X$.

### **Conditioning on Random Variables**

- As we have explained else where, conditioning on an event can be understood as mapping a probility measure into another probability measure. 

$$\mathcal{C}:: \mathcal{M} \to \mathcal{F}_+ \to \mathcal{M}$$

- Events are isomphic to indicator random variables, where the $\sigma$-algebra of the indicator random variable for the event $A$ is the following

$$\{\emptyset, \Omega, A, A^c \}$$

- Conditioning on a random variable can then be understood as "lifting" the above function!

$$\tilde{C} :: \mathcal{M} \to (\Omega \to \mathcal{R}) \to \mathcal{F}_{\sigma(X)} \to \mathcal{M}$$
